# Cloud Web App

## 👋 Introduction

This mono-repo is used to demonstrate how an entire web app could be composed, configured and deployed to a cloud provider.
It can currently be deployed to [AWS] using the [Terraform] configuration provided.

Both the [React] web app and [GraphQL] API use [TypeScript], [Yarn] and a host of smaller dependencies to keep the
developer experience consistent. Open this repo in [Visual Studio Code] to use its recommended extensions and settings.

## 🤖 Setup

### 🌍 Global

First, use [Git] to clone this repository.

If you are running Windows, inspect `.\windows-setup.ps1`, then install [Chocolatey] and run that script to install any
missing dependencies. Similar commands like `apt-get` are available for Linux distros.

### 📌 Local

Run the GraphQL API in one terminal with:

```bash
cd api
yarn install
yarn start
```

Now run the web app in another terminal using:

```bash
cd app
yarn install
yarn start
```

## 🕴 Real-World

Were this a real-world application, I would add/change:

- Split the API and web app into separate repositories, and use a package manager such as [Gemfury] to share private code,
    such as the GraphQL schema and models, via npm packages.
- Add [🐶 Husky][Husky] to each separate repo to run a build, lint and unit tests before pushing to its remote.

## ⏳ History

- The GraphQL API was set up using the _Get started with Apollo Server_ [guide][apollo-guide].
- The web app was generated by the _create-react-app_ TypeScript [template][create-react-app].
- The Git commit message format is based on [gitm😜ji][gitmoji].
